// AssetPath.h - Compile-time asset root
//
// The original hardcodes GAME_DATA_ROOT in front of every asset path. This project keeps
// the same tree under ".\assets\USA\" for development, so the only thing that
// differs is the root.
//
// That substitution is done at COMPILE TIME, with GAME_DATA_ROOT standing in for
// the original's GAME_DATA_ROOT literal. An earlier revision instead rewrote paths at
// runtime (ResolveAssetPath, which scanned for a "\usa\" component and spliced in
// "\assets\USA\"). That was worse in two ways:
//
//   1. It was a behavioural divergence with no counterpart in the original - a
//      string transform sitting between the game and the filesystem.
//   2. It was not idempotent, and nothing stopped it running twice. Once the sound
//      loaders resolved a path and handed the result to CreateSound, which resolved
//      again, ".\assets\USA\voice\V001_00.wav" matched its own "\USA\" component
//      and became ".\assets\assets\USA\voice\V001_00.wav".
//
// A macro cannot double-apply, and it keeps the path literals in the decompiled
// code reading the way the original's do.
